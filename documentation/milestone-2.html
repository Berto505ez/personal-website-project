<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

<h2>Welcome Card:</h2>
<p>This portion will introduce myself and my rock-hounding/hunting hobby. It will contain an inviting/encouraging message as well as a description of what this website will contain.</p>

<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>This component will describe how I got into rock-hounding, how long I've been rock-hounding, where I like to go, and what makes me choose certain rocks over others.</p>

<h2>Rock Gallery:</h2>
<p>I will display my coolest rocks.</p>

<h2>Contact Form:</h2>
<p>This element will have a straightforward contact form with a message up top of what possible entries they can submit in the message portion (let me know about my rocks/places to go rock hunting/give me their contact info to go rock hunting together/let me know they like my website etc.).</p>

<h2>Wireframes:</h2>
<p>My website will have a simple consistent layout that is fully reactive for big and small screens.</p>
<p>MockFlow was used to make all my wireframes below.</p>
