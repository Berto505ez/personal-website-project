<h1>Milestone 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This project will be for sharing my love for rocks and my rock collection. The contact form is for any individual that likes rocks. They can also let me know about my rocks(if they know what kind of rocks I have of course), submit places to go rock hunting, or give me their contact info to link up to go rock hunting together. If I receive any valuable info about my rocks, I will update my site with that info.</p>
<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p>This site is intended for ALL rock lovers on any scale of knowledge about them.</p>
<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>My end goal is for anyone that visits my page either gain some knowledge or give some knowledge about rocks... or just browse my rocks.</p>

<h1>Persona</h1>
<h2>Name: Gavin Salvador</h2>

<h2>Tech:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Casual mobile user, using an iPhone 12 with a 6-inch display running IOS software and using safari as his default browser.</li>
    <li>Intermediate user, using an ASUS Notebook E203 with a 11.6-inch display running OS Windows 10 and using chrome as browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Attitudes, Needs & Frustrations:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gavin is using this site to gain a rock-hunting friend by giving some rock wisdom and contact info.</li>
    <li>Finds the site most suitable for his case because he can receive some extra hands and have someone to share his knowledge with</li>
    <li>Gavin is in need of a rock-hunting associate. Gavin rock-hunts frequently but always is inconvenienced somehow by, not being able to carry a big rock by himself, not having enough space in his own vehicle, no one to share his finds/knowledge with and sometimes frightened that he's out in the wilderness alone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>Get someone with the same rock interest to go rock-hunting with him.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>User Story:</h2>
<p>As a first-time visitor I want to befriend the owner of this website and share my knowledge of rocks.</p>
